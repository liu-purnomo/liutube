## Video Playback Logic

### Playback Modes

1. **Embedded YouTube Player** (Default)
   - Uses official YouTube embed
   - Supports all YouTube features
   - Best compatibility with most content

2. **Direct Video Streaming** (Fallback/Manual)
   - Direct video URL streaming
   - Used when embedded player fails
   - Accessible via floating "Direct" button

### When Videos Show "Unavailable"

If you encounter "Video Unavailable" messages:

1. **Click the "Direct" Button**: Look for the semi-transparent "Direct" button in the top-left corner of the video player
2. **Try Download Instead**: Use the download feature as an alternative
3. **Common Causes**:
   - Age-restricted content
   - Music videos with copyright restrictions
   - Region-blocked content
   - Premium/paid content

### Direct Play Button
- **Location**: Top-left corner of video player
- **Transparency**: 30% opacity by default, becomes fully visible on hover
- **Function**: Attempts direct video streaming when embedded player fails
- **Appearance**: Red highlight on hover with ðŸŽ¬ icon

## Download System

### Download Process
1. **Multiple Fallback Methods**: 
   - Simple fetch download
   - ytdl-core extraction  
   - Direct URL download
   - Stream-based download

2. **Download Locations**: Files are saved to your system's Downloads folder

3. **Supported Content**: 
   - Regular videos
   - Music videos (often downloads work even when streaming doesn't)
   - Most YouTube content types

### Download Manager
- **Real-time Progress**: Shows download speed, progress percentage, and file size
- **Auto-cleanup**: Completed downloads auto-remove after 10 seconds
- **Error Handling**: Failed downloads auto-remove after 5 seconds
- **Cancellation**: Stop downloads in progress (where supported)

## History Management

### What Gets Recorded
- **Video Information**: Title, channel name, thumbnail, duration
- **Timestamps**: When the video was accessed
- **Watch Count**: How many times you've watched each video
- **Metadata**: Additional video details for future reference

### When History is Created
- **On Video Play**: History entry created when you click play on any video
- **Update on Re-watch**: Existing entries get updated timestamp and incremented watch count
- **Automatic**: No manual action required

### When History is Removed
- **Manual Removal**: Click "Remove" button on individual history items
- **Clear All**: Use "Clear All" button to wipe entire history
- **Auto-cleanup**: History is limited to 100 most recent items (older entries auto-removed)
- **Search Filtering**: Use search bar to filter history by title or channel name
